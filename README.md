Link to deployed version of app:

App overview and technologies used:

This app is a burger logger which utilizes MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. It follows the MVC design pattern and uses Node and MySQL to query and route data. Handlebars is used to generate the HTML.


How to use it:
Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
Whenever a user submits a burger's name, it displays the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger moves to the right side of the page. Every burger is stored in a database, whether devoured or not.
